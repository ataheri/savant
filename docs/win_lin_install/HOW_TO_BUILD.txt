How to build the Linux and Windows Installers


1. Enter the "Files" directory and replace "lib", "plugins" and "Savant.jar" with the current dist.
(2. Edit "Savant.exe" to have the current version number. This has not been done in the past.) 
3. Open "InstallJammer.mpi" with Install Jammer.
4. Under "Application Information" update the "Install Version" and "Version String" fields.
5. In "Groups and Files" remove all files from "Program Files".
6. Drag and drop all files from "Files" into the "Program Files" directory.
7. Uncheck any unnecessary files (Readme's, .svn folders...).
8. For Windows build, uncheck "Savant.sh". Go to "Build Installers" and check Windows only. Build Install.
9. For Linux/Zip, return to "Groups and Files". Check "Savant.sh" and uncheck "Savant.exe" and "Savant.ini". Go to "Build Installers" and check Linux x86, Linux x86 64 and Tar Archive. Build Install.
